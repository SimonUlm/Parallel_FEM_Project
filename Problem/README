### problem.co ###
# line number = node number i=0,...,ncoords-1
x_i     y_i     # (x_i, y_i) coordinate of node i

### problem.el ###
# line number = element number
# element is defined through 3 nodes with number n1, n2, n3 (anticlockwise order)
# the numbering of the mid points is distinct from the node numbering
# between node n1 and node n2 there is mid point m1
# between node n2 and node n3 there is mid point m2
# between node n3 and node n1 there is mid point m3
# the element is a component of FEM-structure with number affiliation
n1  n2  n3  m1   m2   m3   affiliation

### problem.bd ###
# bdry edge is defined through node n1 and node n2, it has the edge number edgeNr
# and is of type type (0=dirichlet, 1=neumann)
n1  n2 edgeNr type
